 PREPROCESSOR WARNING MESSAGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***WARNING: There are 190 warning messages in the data (.dat) file.  Please
            check the data file for possible errors in the input file.



***WARNING: In step 1, some facet thicknesses for general contact were reduced
            from the parent element or specified values due to a large
            thickness compared to facet dimensions.  The most significant
            thickness scaling factor was 3.94311E-02 for a facet on parent
            element 1201 of instance OPAL325_LA-1.  An element set named
            "WarnElemGContThickReduce" has been created to locate the regions
            of reduced thickness.


***WARNING: In step 1, some contact edge thicknesses for general contact were
            reduced from the parent element or specified values due to a large
            thickness compared to edge dimensions.  The most significant
            thickness scaling factor was 2.65934E-02 for an edge on parent
            element 5 of instance OPAL325_ATLA-1.  An element set named
            "WarnElemGContThickReduce" has been created to locate the regions
            of reduced thickness.


***WARNING: In step 1, portions of master surfaces in the general contact
            domain have been tied together.  Joining disconnected surfaces
            with *TIE does not alter the surface connectivity and results in a
            seam in the contact surface.  The nodes along the tied surface
            perimeters have been added to the node set named
            "WarnNodePerimTieSeam".


***WARNING: The nodes in node set WarnNodeCnsIntersectKinC are part of a
            kinematic contact surface definition as well as participate in a
            kinematic constraint (or distributing coupling). Nodes that
            participate in a kinematic constraint definition should not be
            used in a kinematic contact surface definition. If a
            degree-of-freedom participates in both types of constraints, the
            kinematic contact constraint will most often override the
            kinematic constraint. Abaqus/Explicit will not prevent the user
            from defining these conditions, but the results cannot be
            guaranteed. It is suggested that the penalty contact algorithm be
            used.


***WARNING: Each of the nodes listed below (and included in node set
            "WarnNodeBcIntersectKinCon") participates in a boundary condition
            definition (*BOUNDARY) as well as being part of a kinematic
            contact definition (*CONTACT PAIR, MECHANICAL CONSTRAINT =
            KINEMATIC). If a degree-of-freedom participates in both types of
            constraints, the boundary condition will override the kinematic
            contact constraint. In case of a conflict, it is suggested that
            the penalty contact algorithm be used instead.

  INFORMATION REGARDING INITIAL CONTACT OVERCLOSURES FOR NEWLY DEFINED GENERAL
  CONTACT INTERACTIONS IN STEP 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 178 initial node-face overclosure(s).


  Maximum initial overclosure for node-face contact is 1.6430 at node 23 of
  instance OPAL325_CL_V6-1 and face SNEG of element 8 of instance
  OPAL325_AVW_V6-1.


  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 722 initial edge-edge overclosure(s).


  Maximum initial overclosure for edge-edge contact is 0.62190 between the
  edge defined by nodes 293 and 294 of instance OPAL325_ATFP-1 and the edge
  defined by nodes 217 and 218 of instance OPAL325_LA-1


  Maximum initial contact adjustment is: 0.66308 at node 296 of instance
  OPAL325_ATFP-1.


  107 node-face overclosure(s) left unresolved and will be stored as offsets.
  To help identify the nodes involved in the overclosures a node set
  InfoNodeUnresolvInitOver has been created. Check the message file for more
  detailed information.


  Maximum unresolved overclosure is 1.6430 at node 23 of instance
  OPAL325_CL_V6-1 and face SNEG of element 8 of instance OPAL325_AVW_V6-1.


  162 edge-edge overclosure(s) left unresolved and will be stored as offsets.
  To help identify the nodes involved in the overclosures a node set
  InfoNodeUnresolvInitOver has been created. Check the message file for more
  detailed information.


  Maximum unresolved overclosure is 0.42421 between the edge defined by nodes
  14 and 15 of instance OPAL325_PM_MID-1 and the edge defined by nodes 115 and
  116 of instance OPAL325_LA-1


***WARNING: 81 slave nodes have been found to be coincident with the reference
            plane of double-sided elements after the completion of the initial
            overclosure procedure (81 were detected in the original model). It
            may be neccessary to manually adjust the configuration of these
            nodes (e.g. via the *CONTACT CLEARANCE ASSIGNMENT option). These
            slave nodes have been added to the node set
            WarnNodeCoincidRefPlane. Check the message file for more detailed
            information.


***WARNING: 2 surface intersections have been detected after the completion of
            the initial overclosure procedure (2 were detected in the original
            model).  It may be neccessary to manually adjust the configuration
            of the intersecting surfaces (e.g. via the *CONTACT CLEARANCE
            ASSIGNMENT option). The elements involved in these intersections
            have been added to the elset WarnElemSurfaceIntersect. Check the
            message file for more detailed information.


  More detailed information on initial overclosures can be found in the
  message (.msg) file.


***NOTE: You can view the deformed configuration due to the resolution of
         initial overclosures.  In increment 0, draw the deformed shape or
         draw a symbol plot of vector displacements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***WARNING: For surface ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF555, some facets have an offset
            which is greater than one-half times an edge or diagonal length of
            the facet (for example, the offset is 0.68298 times the element
            size for the facet on parent element 3188 of instance
            OPAL325_AVW_V6-1). This surface may be poorly defined near any

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

***WARNING: For contact pairs that are not tied, unresolved initial
            overclosures will result in initial accelerations on the order of
            the penetration distance divided by the time increment squared,
            which can lead to significant mesh distortion. These overclosures
            can be avoided by user adjustment of the mesh.


  Maximum overclosure between surface ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF689 and surface
  ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF688 is 9.42964E-08.



  Maximum overclosure between surface ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF555 and surface

            OPAL325_AVW_V6-1). This surface may be poorly defined near any
            angles or corners in the  surface.


***WARNING: For contact surface ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF689, some facets are
            thicker than 0.6 times an edge or diagonal length of the facet
            (for example, the thickness is 11.0408      times the element size
            for the facet on parent element OPAL325_LA-1.1201). This may lead
            to unstable contact involving the bull-nose extension on the
            surface perimeter, which could be avoided by using the MAXRATIO
            parameter on *SURFACE.

***WARNING: For contact surface ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF659, some facets are
            thicker than 0.6 times an edge or diagonal length of the facet
            (for example, the thickness is 2.95297     times the element size
            for the facet on parent element OPAL325_PBODY-1.46). This may lead
            to unstable contact involving the bull-nose extension on the
            surface perimeter, which could be avoided by using the MAXRATIO
            parameter on *SURFACE.

***WARNING: In contact pair 2, node 530 of instance OPAL325_LA-1 on the slave
            surface ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF689 has 297.56 times more mass than
            the mass of node 44 of instance OPAL325_GIFILLER-1 on the master
            surface ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF688. Significant contact noise may
            result with the kinematic contact algorithm when the slave nodes
            have significantly greater mass than the master nodes. Suggested
            workarounds include setting the WEIGHT parameter so that surface
            ASSEMBLY__PICKEDSURF688 is a pure slave surface in the contact
            pair, using mass-scaling to adjust the ratio of nodal masses, or
            using the penalty contact algorithm.
